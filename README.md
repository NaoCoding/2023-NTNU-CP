```
This repository is all about CP courses for freshman from NTNU.
All of the code are published after the course was ended,
so don't afraid about cheating issues.

There are five homework and two online exam during CP1 in 2023 Fall Semester.
And below are my scores, questions which I didn't get full score should not consider my file as best/good answer.

Hw1 : 20 20 15 20 18 5, sum : 98/110
