	I searched stackoverflow and I consider that while we add ".IGNORE:" at the beginning of the makefile, 
we can easily ignore all the errors and compile all the file even when some of them are failed to compile. For 
example, if we add ".IGNORE:" in the original makefile.
	
.IGNORE:	
all:
	gcc a.c -o a 
	gcc b.c -o b 


	With ".IGNORE:", we can easily compile b.c even when a.c is failed to compile. Although the a.c will not be 
	compiled successfully since a.c possess some problems or issues, the b.c can still be compiled as long as it 
	has no any problems. Therefore, I consider that the answer will be adding ".IGNORE:" in the front of the 
	makefile.
